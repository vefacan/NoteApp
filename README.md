# NoteApp

The Goal of the Project
-------------

<p>
This project is a note application written using Sqlite. It consists of three pages (including Splash Screen).
In the application, you can enter the title, description and date of the note and add it to the page, and you can delete the note at any time by clicking it.
This is the 7rd homework I prepared in my "Turkcell - Geleceği Yazanlar" course.
